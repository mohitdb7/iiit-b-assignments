    "## **RAG with Langchain - Why Use LangChain?**\n",
    "\n",
    "LangChain, a framework designed for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs), offers several key advantages that are evident in the provided code:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Modular and Extensible Architecture:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Component-Based Approach:** LangChain's modular design allows for easy integration of different components, such as document loaders, text splitters, vector stores, embeddings, and language models. This flexibility enables you to customize and tailor the system to your specific needs.\n",
    "* **Customizable Prompts:** The framework provides tools to create and manage prompts, which are the instructions given to the LLM. This allows you to fine-tune the LLM's responses and guide its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Efficient Data Handling:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Document Loading and Processing:** LangChain offers efficient methods for loading and processing documents, including PDF files. This simplifies the process of extracting relevant information from large datasets.\n",
    "* **Text Splitting:** The `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` used in the code ensures that text is split into manageable chunks while preserving context. This is crucial for effective processing by LLMs.\n",
    "* **Vector Database:** The use of a vector database (Chroma) enables efficient storage and retrieval of embeddings, which are numerical representations of text. This facilitates semantic search and similarity matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Integration with LLMs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Language Model Interaction:** LangChain provides seamless integration with various LLMs, including Google's Gemini. This allows you to leverage the power of these models for tasks like question answering, summarization, and text generation.\n",
    "* **Prompt Engineering:** The framework's support for prompt engineering helps you craft effective prompts that guide the LLM's responses and improve the quality of the generated content.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Workflow Management:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **RAG Chains:** The ability to create RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) chains allows you to combine document retrieval, prompt engineering, and LLM generation into a cohesive workflow. This streamlines the process of building question-answering systems and other applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Extensibility and Customization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Custom Components:** LangChain allows you to create custom components, such as custom retrievers or output parsers, to tailor the framework to your specific requirements.\n",
    "* **Integration with Other Tools:** You can easily integrate LangChain with other tools and libraries to enhance its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary, LangChain provides a robust and flexible framework for building applications powered by LLMs. Its modular architecture, efficient data handling, seamless integration with LLMs, and extensibility make it a valuable tool for a wide range of natural language processing tasks.**\n"

    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`{\"context\" : results_runnable, \"question\" : RunnablePassthrough()}`:**\n",
    "  - This creates a dictionary that defines the components of the RAG chain:\n",
    "    - `context`: Specifies the `results_runnable` function as the context retriever. This function will be used to retrieve relevant documents based on the query.\n",
    "    - `question`: Specifies the `RunnablePassthrough` object as the question handler. This object will simply pass the query through without any modification.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`| prompt`:**\n",
    "  - This pipe operator connects the context and question components to a prompt template. The prompt template will be used to format the query and retrieved documents into a suitable input for the language model.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`| llm`:**\n",
    "  - This pipe operator connects the prompt template to the `llm` object, which represents the language model (in this case, the Gemini model). The language model will process the formatted prompt and generate a response.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **`| StrOutputParser()`:**\n",
    "  - This pipe operator connects the language model to the `StrOutputParser` object. This parser will ensure that the output from the language model is parsed as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Impact:**\n",

    "After running this code, the `rag_chain` variable will contain a RAG chain that can be used to answer questions based on the retrieved documents. When a query is provided to the RAG chain, it will:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Retrieve relevant documents using the `results_runnable` function.\n",

    "4. Parse the output from the language model as a string.\n",

    "The final output will be the generated response from the language model, based on the query and the retrieved documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- The specific prompt template used in the RAG chain will determine how the query and retrieved documents are combined into an input for the language model.\n",
    "- You can customize the RAG chain by modifying the context retriever, prompt template, language model, or output parser.\n",

    "## **RAG with LlamaIndex - Why Use Llama Index**\n",
    "\n",
    "Llama Index, a framework designed for building applications powered by large language models (LLMs), offers several key advantages that are evident in the provided code:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Efficient Document Management and Retrieval:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vector Store Index:** The use of a vector store index allows for efficient storage and retrieval of documents based on their semantic similarity. This enables the system to quickly find relevant information based on the context of the query.\n",
    "* **Document Loading and Processing:** Llama Index provides tools for loading and processing documents, including text splitting and embedding generation. This simplifies the process of preparing documents for use with the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Flexible Query Processing:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Retriever and Query Engine:** The `RetrieverQueryEngine` combines a retriever for document retrieval and a response synthesizer for generating responses. This modular architecture allows for customization and flexibility in the query processing pipeline.\n",
    "* **Prompt Engineering:** Llama Index provides tools for creating and managing prompts, which are the instructions given to the LLM. This allows you to fine-tune the LLM's responses and guide its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Integration with LLMs:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Seamless Integration:** Llama Index seamlessly integrates with various LLMs, including Gemini. This enables you to leverage the power of these models for tasks like question answering, summarization, and text generation.\n",
    "* **Customization:** The framework allows you to customize the LLM's behavior through prompt engineering and other techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Extensibility and Customization:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Custom Components:** Llama Index provides a modular architecture that allows you to create custom components, such as retrievers, response synthesizers, or postprocessors, to tailor the system to your specific needs.\n",
    "* **Integration with Other Tools:** You can easily integrate Llama Index with other tools and libraries to enhance its capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Performance and Efficiency:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Optimized for Large Datasets:** Llama Index is designed to handle large datasets efficiently, making it suitable for applications that require processing and querying vast amounts of information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary, Llama Index offers a robust and flexible framework for building applications powered by LLMs. Its efficient document management, flexible query processing, integration with LLMs, extensibility, and performance make it a valuable tool for a wide range of natural language processing tasks.**\n"

    "- **`Settings.embed_model = HuggingFaceEmbedding(model_name=\"BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5\")`:** Sets the `embed_model` setting in Llama Index to the `HuggingFaceEmbedding` class, specifying the model name \"BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5\". This will use the specified Hugging Face model for generating embeddings.\n",
    "- **`Settings.llm = Gemini(model_name=\"models/gemini-1.5-pro\")`:** Sets the `llm` setting in Llama Index to the `Gemini` class, specifying the model name \"models/gemini-1.5-pro\". This will use the Gemini 1.5 Pro language model for generating responses.\n",

You can now use Llama Index to interact with these models and perform tasks like question answering, summarization, and text generation."
