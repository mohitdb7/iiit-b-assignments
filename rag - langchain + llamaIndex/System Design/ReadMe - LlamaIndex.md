### **Project: RAG Question-Answering System - LlamaIndex**

**Purpose:**
This project implements a question-answering system capable of providing informative responses based on a given set of documents. It leverages natural language processing techniques to understand user queries and retrieve relevant information from the documents.

**Key Features:**

* **Document Ingestion:** Reads and processes documents from specified directories.
* **Embedding:** Converts text into numerical representations (embeddings) for efficient comparison.
* **Indexing:** Stores embeddings and corresponding document metadata in a vector store for fast retrieval.
* **Query Processing:** Receives user queries, retrieves relevant documents, and generates responses.

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x
* Hugging Face Transformers library
* Gemini language model
* Vector store library (e.g., Faiss, Annoy)

**Installation:**
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/question-answering-system.git
   ```
2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Obtain API keys for Hugging Face and Gemini, and place them in the appropriate files (e.g., `API/hf_token` and `API/gemini_key`).

**Usage:**
1. Prepare your documents and place them in the specified directory.
2. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
3. Enter your query and the system will provide a response.

**Customization:**
* **Documents:** Modify the `documents` directory to include your desired documents.
* **Embedding Model:** Experiment with different embedding models to find the best fit for your use case.
* **Indexing:** Adjust the indexing parameters (e.g., similarity metric, number of neighbors) to optimize performance.
* **Language Model:** Customize the language model's settings to influence response generation.

**Additional Notes:**
* For large datasets, consider using distributed indexing and query processing.
* Experiment with different preprocessing techniques (e.g., stemming, lemmatization, stop word removal) to improve accuracy.
* Evaluate the system's performance using metrics like accuracy, recall, and precision.
* Continuously update the system with new documents and retrain models as needed.
