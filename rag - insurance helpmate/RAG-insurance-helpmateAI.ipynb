    "## Problem statement\n",
    "The goal of the project will be to build a robust generative search system capable of effectively and accurately answering questions from a policy document. \n",
    "\n",
    "[Group Member Life Insurance Policy](Principal-Sample-Life-Insurance-Policy.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "The project should implement all the three layers effectively. It will be key to try out various strategies and experiments in various layers in order to build an effective search system. Let's explore what you need to do in each of the layers, and the possible experimentations that you can perform based on various choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The Embedding Layer:** The PDF document needs to be effectively processed, cleaned, and chunked for the embeddings. Here, the choice of the chunking strategy will have a large impact on the final quality of the retrieved results. So, make sure that you try out various stratgies and compare their performances.\n",
    "Another important aspect in the embedding layer is the choice of the embedding model. You can choose to embed your chunks using the OpenAI embedding model or any model from the SentenceTransformers library on HuggingFace.\n",
    "- **The Search Layer:** Here, you first need to design at least 3 queries against which you will test your system. You need to understand and skim through the document, and accordingly come up with some queries, the answers to which can be found in the policy document.\n",
    "Next, you need to embed the queries and search your ChromaDB vector database against each of these queries. Implementing a cache mechanism is also mandatory.\n",
    "Finally, you need to implement the re-ranking block, and for this you can choose from a range of cross-encoding models on HuggingFace. \n",
    "- **The Generation Layer:** In the generation layer, the final prompt that you design is the major component. Make sure that the prompt is exhaustive in its instructions, and the relevant information is correctly passed to the prompt. You may also choose to provide some few-shot examples in an attempt to improve the LLM output.\n",
    "Make sure you try out different strategies and models in each layer, and you might be surprised with the variety of top answers retrieved and generated by your system. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** You need to test your system with at least 3 self-designed queries that can help you gauge the quality of outputs delivered by your system. Also, as a check, you need to submit the screenshots of the outputs along with the code and documentation. The details of the screenshots that you need to share are provided below.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Top 3 Results from the Search Layer:** You need to share 3 screenshots against 3 self-designed queries that clearly showcase the top 3 results/chunks retrieved from the search layer. Please share 1 screenshot for each query and its output.\n",
    "- **Final Generated Answer from the Generation Layer:** Here, you are required to share 3 screenshots of the same 3 queries with the final output generated by the LLM in the generation layer. Please share one screenshot for each query and its output.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, overall, you will need to share 6 screenshots."

Actively at Work A Member's effective date for Member Life Insurance will be as explained in this article, if the Member is Actively at Work on that date. If the Member is not Actively at Work on the date insurance would otherwise be effective, such insurance will not be in force until the day of return to Active Work. However, this Actively at Work requirement will be waived for Members who: (1) are absent from Active Work because of a regularly scheduled day off, holiday, or vacation day; and (2) were Actively at Work on their last scheduled work day before the date of their absence; and (3) were capable of Active Work on the day before the scheduled effective date of their insurance or change in their insurance, whichever is applicable. This Actively at Work requirement may also be waived as described below. When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy, the Active Work requirement may be waived for those Members who: (1) are eligible and enrolled under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue; and (2) were covered under the Prior Policy on the date of its termination. In no event will the Active Work requirement be waived for those Members who, on the date of termination of the Prior Policy, either: (1) had the option, under the terms of the Prior Policy, to convert their coverage under the Prior Policy to an individual policy; or (2) were eligible under the terms of the Prior Policy, to have their premiums waived due to ADL Disability or Total Disability. NOTE: When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy and the Active Work requirement is waived, any benefits payable will be the lesser of the Scheduled Benefit of this Group Policy or the amount that would have been paid by the Prior Policy had it remained in force. b.

Effective Date for Initial Noncontributory Insurance When Proof of Good Health is not Required Unless Proof of Good Health is required (see b. above and e. below), insurance for which the Member contributes no part of premium will be in force on the date the Member is eligible. d. Effective Date for Initial Contributory Insurance When Proof of Good Health is not Required If a Member is to contribute a part of premium, insurance must be requested in a form provided by The Principal. Unless Proof of Good Health is required (see b. above and e. below), the requested insurance will be in force on: (1) the date the Member is eligible, if the request is made on or before that date; or (2) the date of the Member's request, if the request is made within 31 days after the date the Member is eligible. If the request is made more than 31 days after the date the Member is eligible, Proof of Good Health will be required before insurance can be in force (see b. above and e. below). e. Proof of Good Health Requirements The type and form of required Proof of Good Health will be determined by The Principal. A Member must submit Proof of Good Health: (1) If insurance for which a Member contributes a part of premium is requested more than 31 days after the date the Member is eligible including any insurance the Member refuses and later requests. (2) If insurance is requested under this Group Policy by a Member that was eligible under the Prior Policy, but elected to waive coverage under the Prior Policy. (3) If a Member has failed to provide required Proof of Good Health or has been refused insurance under this Group Policy at any prior time. (4) If a Member elects to terminate insurance and, more than 31 days later, requests to be insured again. (5) If, on the date a Member becomes eligible, fewer than five Members are insured.

Article 6 - Member Life Insurance - Coverage During Disability A Member may be eligible to continue his or her Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance coverage during the Member's ADL Disability or Total Disability. a. Coverage Qualification To be qualified for Coverage During Disability, a Member must: (1) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled while insured for Member Life Insurance; and (2) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled prior to the attainment of age 60; and (3) remain ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled continuously; and (4) be under the regular care and attendance of a Physician; and (5) send proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability to The Principal when required; and (6) submit to Medical Examinations or Evaluations when required; and (7) return to The Principal, without claim, any individual policy issued under his or her Individual Purchase Rights as described in PART III, Section F, Article 1. Upon return of such policy, The Principal will refund premiums paid, less dividends and less any outstanding policy loan balance. b. Proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability must be sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability begins. Further proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability has not ended must be sent when The Principal requires. After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued for two years from the date the first proof is received, The Principal may not ask for further proof more than once each year. If the Member dies while ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled, final proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability continued to the date of death must be sent to The Principal. If death occurs within one year of the start of ADL Disability or Total Disability, but before The Principal has received first proof, then final proof must be sent within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability began. c.

After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued two years from the date first proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability is received, examinations or evaluations may not be required more than once each year. The Principal will pay for these examinations and evaluations and will choose the Physician or evaluator to perform them. Failure to attend a medical examination or cooperate with the Physician may be cause for denial of the Member's benefits. Failure to attend an evaluation or to cooperate with the evaluator may also be cause for denial of the Member's benefits. If the Member fails to attend an examination or an evaluation, any charges incurred for not attending an appointment as scheduled may be his or her responsibility. d. Effective Dates and Premium Waiver Coverage During Disability will be effective for a qualified Member on the earliest of: (1) the date nine months after the date the Member becomes Totally Disabled; or (2) the date one month after the date the Member becomes ADL Disabled; or (3) the date the Member dies. Premium will not be charged for Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance while the Member's Coverage During Disability is in force. e. Benefits Payable If death occurs while Coverage During Disability is in force, The Principal will pay the Member's beneficiary the Member Life Insurance benefit amount that would have been paid had the Member remained insured under the Schedule of Insurance in force on the date Total Disability began. Such benefit shall be subject to any reduction provided under the Schedule of Insurance. However, NO BENEFIT WILL BE PAID if Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability is not sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability began. Failure to give Written proof within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if Written proof is given as soon as reasonably possible.

Failure to give notice within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. Article 2 - Claim Forms The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss. Article 3 - Proof of Loss Written proof of loss must be sent to The Principal within 90 days after the date of the loss. Proof required includes the date, nature, and extent of the loss. The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal.

The claimant is then allowed up to 45 days to provide all additional information requested. The Principal is permitted two 30-day extensions for processing an incomplete claim. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. In actual practice, benefits under this Group Policy will be payable sooner, provided The Principal receives complete and proper proof of loss.

The Principal will pay for these examinations and will choose the Physician to perform them. Article 6 - Autopsy If payment for loss of life is claimed, The Principal may require an autopsy.

The Principal is not responsible for the provision of such goods and/or services nor is it liable for the failure of the provision of the same. Further, The Principal is not liable to the applicants/insureds/enrollees for the negligent provision of such goods and/or services by the third party service providers.

Actively at Work A Member's effective date for Member Life Insurance will be as explained in this article, if the Member is Actively at Work on that date. If the Member is not Actively at Work on the date insurance would otherwise be effective, such insurance will not be in force until the day of return to Active Work. However, this Actively at Work requirement will be waived for Members who: (1) are absent from Active Work because of a regularly scheduled day off, holiday, or vacation day; and (2) were Actively at Work on their last scheduled work day before the date of their absence; and (3) were capable of Active Work on the day before the scheduled effective date of their insurance or change in their insurance, whichever is applicable. This Actively at Work requirement may also be waived as described below. When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy, the Active Work requirement may be waived for those Members who: (1) are eligible and enrolled under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue; and (2) were covered under the Prior Policy on the date of its termination. In no event will the Active Work requirement be waived for those Members who, on the date of termination of the Prior Policy, either: (1) had the option, under the terms of the Prior Policy, to convert their coverage under the Prior Policy to an individual policy; or (2) were eligible under the terms of the Prior Policy, to have their premiums waived due to ADL Disability or Total Disability. NOTE: When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy and the Active Work requirement is waived, any benefits payable will be the lesser of the Scheduled Benefit of this Group Policy or the amount that would have been paid by the Prior Policy had it remained in force. b.

Effective Date for Initial Noncontributory Insurance When Proof of Good Health is not Required Unless Proof of Good Health is required (see b. above and e. below), insurance for which the Member contributes no part of premium will be in force on the date the Member is eligible. d. Effective Date for Initial Contributory Insurance When Proof of Good Health is not Required If a Member is to contribute a part of premium, insurance must be requested in a form provided by The Principal. Unless Proof of Good Health is required (see b. above and e. below), the requested insurance will be in force on: (1) the date the Member is eligible, if the request is made on or before that date; or (2) the date of the Member's request, if the request is made within 31 days after the date the Member is eligible. If the request is made more than 31 days after the date the Member is eligible, Proof of Good Health will be required before insurance can be in force (see b. above and e. below). e. Proof of Good Health Requirements The type and form of required Proof of Good Health will be determined by The Principal. A Member must submit Proof of Good Health: (1) If insurance for which a Member contributes a part of premium is requested more than 31 days after the date the Member is eligible including any insurance the Member refuses and later requests. (2) If insurance is requested under this Group Policy by a Member that was eligible under the Prior Policy, but elected to waive coverage under the Prior Policy. (3) If a Member has failed to provide required Proof of Good Health or has been refused insurance under this Group Policy at any prior time. (4) If a Member elects to terminate insurance and, more than 31 days later, requests to be insured again. (5) If, on the date a Member becomes eligible, fewer than five Members are insured.

Article 6 - Member Life Insurance - Coverage During Disability A Member may be eligible to continue his or her Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance coverage during the Member's ADL Disability or Total Disability. a. Coverage Qualification To be qualified for Coverage During Disability, a Member must: (1) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled while insured for Member Life Insurance; and (2) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled prior to the attainment of age 60; and (3) remain ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled continuously; and (4) be under the regular care and attendance of a Physician; and (5) send proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability to The Principal when required; and (6) submit to Medical Examinations or Evaluations when required; and (7) return to The Principal, without claim, any individual policy issued under his or her Individual Purchase Rights as described in PART III, Section F, Article 1. Upon return of such policy, The Principal will refund premiums paid, less dividends and less any outstanding policy loan balance. b. Proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability must be sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability begins. Further proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability has not ended must be sent when The Principal requires. After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued for two years from the date the first proof is received, The Principal may not ask for further proof more than once each year. If the Member dies while ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled, final proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability continued to the date of death must be sent to The Principal.

After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued two years from the date first proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability is received, examinations or evaluations may not be required more than once each year. The Principal will pay for these examinations and evaluations and will choose the Physician or evaluator to perform them. Failure to attend a medical examination or cooperate with the Physician may be cause for denial of the Member's benefits. Failure to attend an evaluation or to cooperate with the evaluator may also be cause for denial of the Member's benefits. If the Member fails to attend an examination or an evaluation, any charges incurred for not attending an appointment as scheduled may be his or her responsibility. d. Effective Dates and Premium Waiver Coverage During Disability will be effective for a qualified Member on the earliest of: (1) the date nine months after the date the Member becomes Totally Disabled; or (2) the date one month after the date the Member becomes ADL Disabled; or (3) the date the Member dies. Premium will not be charged for Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance while the Member's Coverage During Disability is in force. e. Benefits Payable If death occurs while Coverage During Disability is in force, The Principal will pay the Member's beneficiary the Member Life Insurance benefit amount that would have been paid had the Member remained insured under the Schedule of Insurance in force on the date Total Disability began. Such benefit shall be subject to any reduction provided under the Schedule of Insurance. However, NO BENEFIT WILL BE PAID if Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability is not sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability began. Failure to give Written proof within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if Written proof is given as soon as reasonably possible.

Failure to give notice within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. Article 2 - Claim Forms The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss. Article 3 - Proof of Loss Written proof of loss must be sent to The Principal within 90 days after the date of the loss. Proof required includes the date, nature, and extent of the loss. The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal.

Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. In actual practice, benefits under this Group Policy will be payable sooner, provided The Principal receives complete and proper proof of loss.

However, this appeal is voluntary and does not need to be filed before asserting rights to legal action. For purposes of this section, \"claimant\" means Member, Dependent, or Beneficiary. Article 5 - Medical Examinations The Principal may have the Member or Dependent whose loss is the basis for claim, be examined by a Physician during the course of a claim. The Principal will pay for these examinations and will choose the Physician to perform them. Article 6 - Autopsy If payment for loss of life is claimed, The Principal may require an autopsy.

In addition, The Principal may arrange for third party service providers (i.e., optometrists, health clubs), to provide discounted goods and services to those employer groups who apply for coverage with The Principal or who become insureds/enrollees of The Principal. While The Principal has arranged these goods, services and/or third party provider discounts, the third party service providers are liable to the applicants/insureds/enrollees for the provision of such goods and/or services. The Principal is not responsible for the provision of such goods and/or services nor is it liable for the failure of the provision of the same. Further, The Principal is not liable to the applicants/insureds/enrollees for the negligent provision of such goods and/or services by the third party service providers.

Actively at Work A Member's effective date for Member Life Insurance will be as explained in this article, if the Member is Actively at Work on that date. If the Member is not Actively at Work on the date insurance would otherwise be effective, such insurance will not be in force until the day of return to Active Work. However, this Actively at Work requirement will be waived for Members who: (1) are absent from Active Work because of a regularly scheduled day off, holiday, or vacation day; and (2) were Actively at Work on their last scheduled work day before the date of their absence; and (3) were capable of Active Work on the day before the scheduled effective date of their insurance or change in their insurance, whichever is applicable. This Actively at Work requirement may also be waived as described below. When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy, the Active Work requirement may be waived for those Members who: (1) are eligible and enrolled under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue; and (2) were covered under the Prior Policy on the date of its termination. In no event will the Active Work requirement be waived for those Members who, on the date of termination of the Prior Policy, either: (1) had the option, under the terms of the Prior Policy, to convert their coverage under the Prior Policy to an individual policy; or (2) were eligible under the terms of the Prior Policy, to have their premiums waived due to ADL Disability or Total Disability. NOTE: When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy and the Active Work requirement is waived, any benefits payable will be the lesser of the Scheduled Benefit of this Group Policy or the amount that would have been paid by the Prior Policy had it remained in force. b.

Effective Date for Initial Contributory Insurance When Proof of Good Health is not Required If a Member is to contribute a part of premium, insurance must be requested in a form provided by The Principal. Unless Proof of Good Health is required (see b. above and e. below), the requested insurance will be in force on: (1) the date the Member is eligible, if the request is made on or before that date; or (2) the date of the Member's request, if the request is made within 31 days after the date the Member is eligible. If the request is made more than 31 days after the date the Member is eligible, Proof of Good Health will be required before insurance can be in force (see b. above and e. below). e. Proof of Good Health Requirements The type and form of required Proof of Good Health will be determined by The Principal. A Member must submit Proof of Good Health: (1) If insurance for which a Member contributes a part of premium is requested more than 31 days after the date the Member is eligible including any insurance the Member refuses and later requests. (2) If insurance is requested under this Group Policy by a Member that was eligible under the Prior Policy, but elected to waive coverage under the Prior Policy. (3) If a Member has failed to provide required Proof of Good Health or has been refused insurance under this Group Policy at any prior time. (4) If a Member elects to terminate insurance and, more than 31 days later, requests to be insured again. (5) If, on the date a Member becomes eligible, fewer than five Members are insured.

       "30  a . In no event will Dependent Life Insurance be in force for a Member who is not insured for Member Life Insurance. b. If a Dependent spouse is in a Period of Limited Activity on the date Dependent Life Insurance or an increase in Dependent Life Insurance Scheduled Benefit due to a change in the Member's Annual Compensation or insurance class would otherwise be effective, such insurance or increase will not be in force for that Dependent spouse until the Period of Limited Activity ends. However, this Period of Limited Activity requirement may be waived as described below. When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy, the Period of Limited Activity requirement may be waived for those Dependent spouses' who: (1) are eligible and enrolled under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue; and (2) were covered under the Prior Policy on the date of its termination. In no event will the Period of Limited Activity requirement be waived for those Dependent spouses' who, on the date of termination of the Prior Policy had the option, under the terms of the Prior Policy, to convert their coverage, under the Prior Policy, to an individual policy. NOTE: When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy and the Period of Limited Activity requirement is waived, any benefits payable will be the lesser of the Scheduled Benefit of this Group Policy or the amount that would have been paid by the Prior Policy had it remained in force. c. If insurance is requested under this Group Policy for a Dependent spouse that was eligible under the Prior Policy, but elected to waive coverage under the Prior Policy. d. If a Dependent is confined in a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility on the date an increase in the Dependent Life Insurance Scheduled Benefit would otherwise be effective, the Scheduled Benefit in force for the Dependent will continue to apply to the Dependent until such confinement ends. When the Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility confinement ends, the Scheduled Benefit increase will then be in force for the Dependent. e. Any required Proof of Good Health will be with respect to the health of the Member's Dependents. f. If Dependent Life Insurance is in force for a Dependent of the Member, a Member will be insured with respect to a new Dependent (other than a newborn child) on the date the new Dependent is acquired, provided the new Dependent is not then confined in a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility.

Article 6 - Member Life Insurance - Coverage During Disability A Member may be eligible to continue his or her Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance coverage during the Member's ADL Disability or Total Disability. a. Coverage Qualification To be qualified for Coverage During Disability, a Member must: (1) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled while insured for Member Life Insurance; and (2) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled prior to the attainment of age 60; and (3) remain ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled continuously; and (4) be under the regular care and attendance of a Physician; and (5) send proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability to The Principal when required; and (6) submit to Medical Examinations or Evaluations when required; and (7) return to The Principal, without claim, any individual policy issued under his or her Individual Purchase Rights as described in PART III, Section F, Article 1. Upon return of such policy, The Principal will refund premiums paid, less dividends and less any outstanding policy loan balance. b. Proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability must be sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability begins. Further proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability has not ended must be sent when The Principal requires. After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued for two years from the date the first proof is received, The Principal may not ask for further proof more than once each year. If the Member dies while ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled, final proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability continued to the date of death must be sent to The Principal.

After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued two years from the date first proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability is received, examinations or evaluations may not be required more than once each year. The Principal will pay for these examinations and evaluations and will choose the Physician or evaluator to perform them. Failure to attend a medical examination or cooperate with the Physician may be cause for denial of the Member's benefits. Failure to attend an evaluation or to cooperate with the evaluator may also be cause for denial of the Member's benefits. If the Member fails to attend an examination or an evaluation, any charges incurred for not attending an appointment as scheduled may be his or her responsibility. d. Effective Dates and Premium Waiver Coverage During Disability will be effective for a qualified Member on the earliest of: (1) the date nine months after the date the Member becomes Totally Disabled; or (2) the date one month after the date the Member becomes ADL Disabled; or (3) the date the Member dies. Premium will not be charged for Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance while the Member's Coverage During Disability is in force. e. Benefits Payable If death occurs while Coverage During Disability is in force, The Principal will pay the Member's beneficiary the Member Life Insurance benefit amount that would have been paid had the Member remained insured under the Schedule of Insurance in force on the date Total Disability began. Such benefit shall be subject to any reduction provided under the Schedule of Insurance. However, NO BENEFIT WILL BE PAID if Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability is not sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability began. Failure to give Written proof within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if Written proof is given as soon as reasonably possible.

Failure to give notice within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. Article 2 - Claim Forms The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss.

The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal.

However, this appeal is voluntary and does not need to be filed before asserting rights to legal action. For purposes of this section, \"claimant\" means Member, Dependent, or Beneficiary. Article 5 - Medical Examinations The Principal may have the Member or Dependent whose loss is the basis for claim, be examined by a Physician during the course of a claim. The Principal will pay for these examinations and will choose the Physician to perform them. Article 6 - Autopsy If payment for loss of life is claimed, The Principal may require an autopsy.

       "      <td>A claimant may request an appeal of a claim denial by Written request to The Principal within 180 days of receipt of notice of the denial.   The Principal will make a full and fair review of the claim.   The Principal may require additional information to make the review.   The Principal will notify the claimant in Writing of the appeal decision within 45 days after receipt of the appeal request.   If the appeal cannot be processed within the 45-day period because The Principal did not receive the requested additional information, The Principal is permitted a 45-day extension for the review.   Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension.   After exhaustion of the formal appeal process, the claimant may request an additional appeal.   However, this appeal is voluntary and does not need to be filed before asserting rights to legal action.   For purposes of this section, \"claimant\" means Member, Dependent, or Beneficiary.   Article 5 - Medical Examinations The Principal may have the Member or Dependent whose loss is the basis for claim, be examined by a Physician during the course of a claim.   The Principal will pay for these examinations and will choose the Physician to perform them.

The Principal will pay for these examinations and evaluations and will choose the Physician or evaluator to perform them.   Failure to attend a medical examination or cooperate with the Physician may be cause for denial of the Member's benefits.   Failure to attend an evaluation or to cooperate with the evaluator may also be cause for denial of the Member's benefits.   If the Member fails to attend an examination or an evaluation, any charges incurred for not attending an appointment as scheduled may be his or her responsibility.  d  Effective Dates and Premium Waiver Coverage During Disability will be effective for a qualified Member on the earliest of: (1) the date nine months after the date the Member becomes Totally Disabled; or (2) the date one month after the date the Member becomes ADL Disabled; or (3) the date the Member dies.

The Principal will pay for these examinations and evaluations and will choose the Physician or evaluator to perform them.   Failure to attend a medical examination or cooperate with the Physician may be cause for denial of the Member's benefits.   Failure to attend an evaluation or to cooperate with the evaluator may also be cause for denial of the Member's benefits.   If the Member fails to attend an examination or an evaluation, any charges incurred for not attending an appointment as scheduled may be his or her responsibility.  d  Effective Dates and Premium Waiver Coverage During Disability will be effective for a qualified Member on the earliest of: (1) the date nine months after the date the Member becomes Totally Disabled; or (2) the date one month after the date the Member becomes ADL Disabled; or (3) the date the Member dies.

This period will end on the earlier of the Member's death or the date two years after the date of the Accelerated Benefit.   During a premium waiver period: (1) there will be no Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance premium charge for the Member; and (2) Member Life Insurance will not be terminated if the Member ceases Active Work because of his or her Terminal Illness.

If the Member does not survive the Dependent and a beneficiary for Dependent Life has not been named, payment will be to the person named as beneficiary for Member Life Insurance.

This notice must be sent within 20 days after the date of the loss for which claim is being made. Failure to give notice within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. Article 2 - Claim Forms The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss. Article 3 - Proof of Loss Written proof of loss must be sent to The Principal within 90 days after the date of the loss. Proof required includes the date, nature, and extent of the loss. The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal. Article 4 - Payment, Denial, and Review ERISA permits up to 45 days from receipt of claim for processing the claim. If a claim cannot be processed due to incomplete information, The Principal will send a Written explanation prior to the expiration of the 45 days. The claimant is then allowed up to 45 days to provide all additional information requested. The Principal is permitted two 30-day extensions for processing an incomplete claim. Written notification will be sent to the claimant regarding the extension. In actual practice, benefits under this Group Policy will be payable sooner, provided The Principal receives complete and proper proof of loss. Further, if a claim is not payable or cannot be processed, The Principal will submit a detailed explanation of the basis for its denial.

In addition, The Principal may arrange for third party service providers (i.e., optometrists, health clubs), to provide discounted goods and services to those employer groups who apply for coverage with The Principal or who become insureds/enrollees of The Principal.

The Principal is not responsible for the provision of such goods and/or services nor is it liable for the failure of the provision of the same. Further, The Principal is not liable to the applicants/insureds/enrollees for the negligent provision of such goods and/or services by the third party service providers.

Actively at Work A Member's effective date for Member Life Insurance will be as explained in this article, if the Member is Actively at Work on that date. If the Member is not Actively at Work on the date insurance would otherwise be effective, such insurance will not be in force until the day of return to Active Work. However, this Actively at Work requirement will be waived for Members who: (1) are absent from Active Work because of a regularly scheduled day off, holiday, or vacation day; and (2) were Actively at Work on their last scheduled work day before the date of their absence; and (3) were capable of Active Work on the day before the scheduled effective date of their insurance or change in their insurance, whichever is applicable. This Actively at Work requirement may also be waived as described below. When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy, the Active Work requirement may be waived for those Members who: (1) are eligible and enrolled under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue; and (2) were covered under the Prior Policy on the date of its termination. In no event will the Active Work requirement be waived for those Members who, on the date of termination of the Prior Policy, either: (1) had the option, under the terms of the Prior Policy, to convert their coverage under the Prior Policy to an individual policy; or (2) were eligible under the terms of the Prior Policy, to have their premiums waived due to ADL Disability or Total Disability. NOTE: When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy and the Active Work requirement is waived, any benefits payable will be the lesser of the Scheduled Benefit of this Group Policy or the amount that would have been paid by the Prior Policy had it remained in force. b.

Effective Date for Initial Contributory Insurance When Proof of Good Health is not Required If a Member is to contribute a part of premium, insurance must be requested in a form provided by The Principal. Unless Proof of Good Health is required (see b. above and e. below), the requested insurance will be in force on: (1) the date the Member is eligible, if the request is made on or before that date; or (2) the date of the Member's request, if the request is made within 31 days after the date the Member is eligible. If the request is made more than 31 days after the date the Member is eligible, Proof of Good Health will be required before insurance can be in force (see b. above and e. below). e. Proof of Good Health Requirements The type and form of required Proof of Good Health will be determined by The Principal. A Member must submit Proof of Good Health: (1) If insurance for which a Member contributes a part of premium is requested more than 31 days after the date the Member is eligible including any insurance the Member refuses and later requests. (2) If insurance is requested under this Group Policy by a Member that was eligible under the Prior Policy, but elected to waive coverage under the Prior Policy. (3) If a Member has failed to provide required Proof of Good Health or has been refused insurance under this Group Policy at any prior time. (4) If a Member elects to terminate insurance and, more than 31 days later, requests to be insured again. (5) If, on the date a Member becomes eligible, fewer than five Members are insured.

       "30  a . In no event will Dependent Life Insurance be in force for a Member who is not insured for Member Life Insurance. b. If a Dependent spouse is in a Period of Limited Activity on the date Dependent Life Insurance or an increase in Dependent Life Insurance Scheduled Benefit due to a change in the Member's Annual Compensation or insurance class would otherwise be effective, such insurance or increase will not be in force for that Dependent spouse until the Period of Limited Activity ends. However, this Period of Limited Activity requirement may be waived as described below. When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy, the Period of Limited Activity requirement may be waived for those Dependent spouses' who: (1) are eligible and enrolled under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue; and (2) were covered under the Prior Policy on the date of its termination. In no event will the Period of Limited Activity requirement be waived for those Dependent spouses' who, on the date of termination of the Prior Policy had the option, under the terms of the Prior Policy, to convert their coverage, under the Prior Policy, to an individual policy. NOTE: When insurance under this Group Policy replaces coverage under a Prior Policy and the Period of Limited Activity requirement is waived, any benefits payable will be the lesser of the Scheduled Benefit of this Group Policy or the amount that would have been paid by the Prior Policy had it remained in force. c. If insurance is requested under this Group Policy for a Dependent spouse that was eligible under the Prior Policy, but elected to waive coverage under the Prior Policy. d. If a Dependent is confined in a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility on the date an increase in the Dependent Life Insurance Scheduled Benefit would otherwise be effective, the Scheduled Benefit in force for the Dependent will continue to apply to the Dependent until such confinement ends. When the Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility confinement ends, the Scheduled Benefit increase will then be in force for the Dependent. e. Any required Proof of Good Health will be with respect to the health of the Member's Dependents. f. If Dependent Life Insurance is in force for a Dependent of the Member, a Member will be insured with respect to a new Dependent (other than a newborn child) on the date the new Dependent is acquired, provided the new Dependent is not then confined in a Hospital or Skilled Nursing Facility.

Article 6 - Member Life Insurance - Coverage During Disability A Member may be eligible to continue his or her Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance coverage during the Member's ADL Disability or Total Disability. a. Coverage Qualification To be qualified for Coverage During Disability, a Member must: (1) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled while insured for Member Life Insurance; and (2) become ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled prior to the attainment of age 60; and (3) remain ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled continuously; and (4) be under the regular care and attendance of a Physician; and (5) send proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability to The Principal when required; and (6) submit to Medical Examinations or Evaluations when required; and (7) return to The Principal, without claim, any individual policy issued under his or her Individual Purchase Rights as described in PART III, Section F, Article 1. Upon return of such policy, The Principal will refund premiums paid, less dividends and less any outstanding policy loan balance. b. Proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability must be sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability begins. Further proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability has not ended must be sent when The Principal requires. After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued for two years from the date the first proof is received, The Principal may not ask for further proof more than once each year. If the Member dies while ADL Disabled or Totally Disabled, final proof that ADL Disability or Total Disability continued to the date of death must be sent to The Principal.

After ADL Disability or Total Disability has continued two years from the date first proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability is received, examinations or evaluations may not be required more than once each year. The Principal will pay for these examinations and evaluations and will choose the Physician or evaluator to perform them. Failure to attend a medical examination or cooperate with the Physician may be cause for denial of the Member's benefits. Failure to attend an evaluation or to cooperate with the evaluator may also be cause for denial of the Member's benefits. If the Member fails to attend an examination or an evaluation, any charges incurred for not attending an appointment as scheduled may be his or her responsibility. d. Effective Dates and Premium Waiver Coverage During Disability will be effective for a qualified Member on the earliest of: (1) the date nine months after the date the Member becomes Totally Disabled; or (2) the date one month after the date the Member becomes ADL Disabled; or (3) the date the Member dies. Premium will not be charged for Member Life and Member Accidental Death and Dismemberment Insurance and Dependent Life Insurance while the Member's Coverage During Disability is in force. e. Benefits Payable If death occurs while Coverage During Disability is in force, The Principal will pay the Member's beneficiary the Member Life Insurance benefit amount that would have been paid had the Member remained insured under the Schedule of Insurance in force on the date Total Disability began. Such benefit shall be subject to any reduction provided under the Schedule of Insurance. However, NO BENEFIT WILL BE PAID if Written proof of ADL Disability or Total Disability is not sent to The Principal within one year of the date ADL Disability or Total Disability began. Failure to give Written proof within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if Written proof is given as soon as reasonably possible.

Failure to give notice within the time specified will not invalidate or reduce any claim if notice is given as soon as reasonably possible. Article 2 - Claim Forms The Principal, when it receives notice of claim, will provide appropriate claim forms for filing proof of loss. If the forms are not provided within 15 days after The Principal receives notice, the person will be considered to have complied with the requirements of this Group Policy upon submitting, within the time specified below for filing proof of loss, Written proof covering the occurrence, character, and extent of the loss.

The Principal may request additional information to substantiate loss or require a Signed unaltered authorization to obtain that information from the provider. Failure to comply with the request of The Principal could result in declination of the claim. For purposes of satisfying the claims processing timing requirements of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA), receipt of claim will be considered to be met when the appropriate claim form is received by The Principal.

However, this appeal is voluntary and does not need to be filed before asserting rights to legal action. For purposes of this section, \"claimant\" means Member, Dependent, or Beneficiary. Article 5 - Medical Examinations The Principal may have the Member or Dependent whose loss is the basis for claim, be examined by a Physician during the course of a claim. The Principal will pay for these examinations and will choose the Physician to perform them. Article 6 - Autopsy If payment for loss of life is claimed, The Principal may require an autopsy.

If a Member who was insured dies within the 31-day individual purchase period described in PART III, Section F, The Principal will pay his or her beneficiary the individual policy amount, if any, the Member had the right to purchase. No payment will be made before The Principal receives Written proof of the Member's death. Article 3 - Beneficiary A beneficiary should be named at the time a Member applies or enrolls under this Group Policy. A Member may name or later change a named beneficiary by sending a Written request to The Principal. A change will not be effective until recorded by The Principal. Once recorded, the change will apply as of the date the request was Signed. If The Principal properly pays any benefit before a change request is received, that payment may not be contested. Further: a. The naming of a new beneficiary in an application for individual purchase under PART III, Section F, Article 1, will be treated as a beneficiary change request under this Group Policy. b. If a Member's terminated insurance is reinstated, his or her beneficiary will be as recorded on the date of termination. If a Member is insured under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue and this insurance replaces insurance in force on the day immediately before the Date of Issue, the beneficiary named in such replaced insurance and recorded by the Policyholder or The Principal will be the beneficiary under this Group Policy until a new beneficiary is named. Article 4 - Facility of Payment If any of the below occur, benefits will be paid as stated. All such payments will discharge The Principal to the full extent of those payments. a. If a beneficiary is found guilty of the Member's death, such beneficiary may be disqualified from receiving any benefit due. Payment may then be made to any contingent beneficiary or to the executor or administrator of the Member's estate. b. Any benefit due a beneficiary who dies before the Member's death will be paid in equal shares to the Member's surviving beneficiaries.

If the Member is found guilty of the Dependent's death, he or she may be disqualified from receiving any benefit due. Payment may then be made to the executor or administrator of the Dependent's estate. Payment will be subject to the Beneficiary provisions in Article 3 and the Facility of Payment and Settlement of Proceeds provisions of PART IV, Section A. No payment will be made before The Principal receives Written proof of the Dependent's death. Article 3 - Beneficiary A Member may name or later change a named beneficiary by sending a Written request to The Principal. A change will not be effective until recorded by The Principal. Once recorded, the change will apply as of the date the request was Signed. If The Principal properly pays any benefit before a change request is received, that payment may not be contested.

If a Member who was insured dies within the 31-day individual purchase period described in PART III, Section F, The Principal will pay his or her beneficiary the individual policy amount, if any, the Member had the right to purchase. No payment will be made before The Principal receives Written proof of the Member's death. Article 3 - Beneficiary A beneficiary should be named at the time a Member applies or enrolls under this Group Policy. A Member may name or later change a named beneficiary by sending a Written request to The Principal. A change will not be effective until recorded by The Principal.

Further: a. The naming of a new beneficiary in an application for individual purchase under PART III, Section F, Article 1, will be treated as a beneficiary change request under this Group Policy. b. If a Member's terminated insurance is reinstated, his or her beneficiary will be as recorded on the date of termination. If a Member is insured under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue and this insurance replaces insurance in force on the day immediately before the Date of Issue, the beneficiary named in such replaced insurance and recorded by the Policyholder or The Principal will be the beneficiary under this Group Policy until a new beneficiary is named. Article 4 - Facility of Payment If any of the below occur, benefits will be paid as stated. All such payments will discharge The Principal to the full extent of those payments. a. If a beneficiary is found guilty of the Member's death, such beneficiary may be disqualified from receiving any benefit due. Payment may then be made to any contingent beneficiary or to the executor or administrator of the Member's estate. b. Any benefit due a beneficiary who dies before the Member's death will be paid in equal shares to the Member's surviving beneficiaries.

Article 3 - Beneficiary A beneficiary should be named at the time a Member applies or enrolls under this Group Policy. A Member may name or later change a named beneficiary by sending a Written request to The Principal. A change will not be effective until recorded by The Principal. Once recorded, the change will apply as of the date the request was Signed. If The Principal properly pays any benefit before a change request is received, that payment may not be contested. Further: a. The naming of a new beneficiary in an application for individual purchase under PART III, Section F, Article 1, will be treated as a beneficiary change request under this Group Policy. b. If a Member's terminated insurance is reinstated, his or her beneficiary will be as recorded on the date of termination. If a Member is insured under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue and this insurance replaces insurance in force on the day immediately before the Date of Issue, the beneficiary named in such replaced insurance and recorded by the Policyholder or The Principal will be the beneficiary under this Group Policy until a new beneficiary is named.

If a Member who was insured dies within the 31-day individual purchase period described in PART III, Section F, The Principal will pay his or her beneficiary the individual policy amount, if any, the Member had the right to purchase. No payment will be made before The Principal receives Written proof of the Member's death. Article 3 - Beneficiary A beneficiary should be named at the time a Member applies or enrolls under this Group Policy. A Member may name or later change a named beneficiary by sending a Written request to The Principal. A change will not be effective until recorded by The Principal. Once recorded, the change will apply as of the date the request was Signed. If The Principal properly pays any benefit before a change request is received, that payment may not be contested. Further: a. The naming of a new beneficiary in an application for individual purchase under PART III, Section F, Article 1, will be treated as a beneficiary change request under this Group Policy. b. If a Member's terminated insurance is reinstated, his or her beneficiary will be as recorded on the date of termination. If a Member is insured under this Group Policy on its Date of Issue and this insurance replaces insurance in force on the day immediately before the Date of Issue, the beneficiary named in such replaced insurance and recorded by the Policyholder or The Principal will be the beneficiary under this Group Policy until a new beneficiary is named. Article 4 - Facility of Payment If any of the below occur, benefits will be paid as stated. All such payments will discharge The Principal to the full extent of those payments. a. If a beneficiary is found guilty of the Member's death, such beneficiary may be disqualified from receiving any benefit due. Payment may then be made to any contingent beneficiary or to the executor or administrator of the Member's estate. b. Any benefit due a beneficiary who dies before the Member's death will be paid in equal shares to the Member's surviving beneficiaries.

       "Taking an insurance policy at a young age has multiple advantages, as highlighted in the responses. These benefits include lower premiums due to good health and reduced risk exposure, higher coverage amounts, long-term financial security for beneficiaries, longer coverage duration, and the potential accumulation of cash value over time. Young individuals are likely to enjoy better health, leading to cost-effective premiums compared to older policyholders. Additionally, starting a policy early ensures coverage for a substantial part of one's life and the possibility of building a financial asset through cash value accumulation. Policy documents offer detailed insights into Member Life Insurance benefits, Accelerated Benefit payments, and eligibility criteria based on age and health status.\n",

The policy will also specify the amount of the benefit payable in the event of an accidental death.\n",
